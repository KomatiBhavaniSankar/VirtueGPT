# üå∏ VirtueGPT

**From the Gita, Ramayana, and beyond ‚Äì a philosophical guide to a virtuous life.**

VirtueGPT is a **Streamlit-powered conversational AI** that provides philosophical guidance and reflection based on the timeless wisdom of the **Bhagavad Gita**, the **Ramayana**, and the teachings of great Indian philosophers such as **Swami Vivekananda**. It is designed as a **compassionate, philosophical guide** to help users explore questions about life, duty, purpose, and inner peace through the lens of virtue.

## üìñ About The Project

In a world full of distractions, **virtue** stands as a timeless compass. VirtueGPT was built to bridge **ancient philosophy** with **modern AI**, offering a safe, reflective, and empathetic space for **self-discovery and wisdom**. Unlike simple Q\&A bots, VirtueGPT provides **philosophical insights** inspired by scripture and profound thinkers, encouraging deeper reflection rather than quick answers.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **Conversational AI Interface:** An interactive, minimalist chat interface powered by Streamlit.
  * **Gita + Ramayana + Philosophy Dataset:** Responses are grounded in the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, and the public domain works of Indian philosophers like Swami Vivekananda.
  * **Virtue-Centered Guidance:** Answers are contextualized around core virtues like truth, compassion, courage, and wisdom.
  * **Multilingual Verse Display:** View verses in Sanskrit, Telugu, and English.
  * **Voice Support:** Ask questions via microphone input (speech-to-text) and listen to the AI's responses via text-to-speech playback.
  * **Empathetic Persona:** The AI maintains a calm, reflective, and non-preachy tone.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

  * **Frontend:** Streamlit
  * **LLM:** Gemma:2b (via Ollama)
  * **Embedding Model:** TensorFlow Hub (Universal Sentence Encoder)
  * **Vector Database:** ChromaDB
  * **Speech-to-Text:** OpenAI Whisper / SpeechRecognition
  * **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** pyttsx3 / gTTS
  * **Core Architecture:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### üîé Workflow

1.  **Query Embedding:** The user's query is converted into a vector embedding.
2.  **Semantic Search:** ChromaDB retrieves the most relevant verses or philosophical texts.
3.  **Context Assembly:** A context-rich prompt is created with the retrieved verse and commentary.
4.  **Thoughtful Response:** The Gemma LLM generates calm, reflective guidance.
5.  **Voice Output:** The answer is optionally spoken aloud via TTS.
